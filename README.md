# [Option Pricing using Qiskit and Eikon Data API]()

Financial institutions are testing early use-cases of Quantum Technologies for NP hard problems which are uncertain or difficult to optimize. 
In this article, we will introduce the financial instruments called options. We are going to introduce the prevailing quantum approach in pricing European Options. 
Initially we will talk about Option Pricing, later on we will jump to coding- where we will do initial setup, load data from Eikon API, do some basic analysis, implement European Options.
